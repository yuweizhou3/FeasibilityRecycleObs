## <a name="overview"/> Overview

This repository contains the code for the Judge Shopping project. The Judge Shopping project
aims to study the judicial system of South Carolina. This judicial system is particularly of interest because in it, judges rotate across counties. This allows defendants to have some choice with regards to the judge that hears their case. Previous studies have found this system to be more equitable than systems with stricter sentencing guidlines. The purpose of this project is to study how changes to the system would affect sentencing outcomes.  This involves first specifying a model of the system, estimating the relevant parameters, and then simulating the system.

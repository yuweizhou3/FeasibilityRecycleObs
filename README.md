This repository contains the code and the results for the experiments in Section 6 of the paper "Finding Feasible Systems for Subjective Constraints Using Recycled Observations".

## 1. Proposed Procedures

We provide the folder `procedures` to contain the code for the proposed procedure ${\cal RF}$ and the other four competing procedures ${\cal RF}$

1. `rf.cpp`: this code is used to test the performance of Procedure 
2. `recycle.cpp`: this code is used to test the performance of Procedure 
3. `restart_max.cpp`: this code is used to test the performance of Procedure 
4. `restart_prob.cpp`: this code is used to test the performance of Procedure 
5. `restart_sum.cpp`: this code is used to test the performance of Procedure 
Note that the experiments in Section 6 are only contain by procedures 

## 2. Inventory Example

We provide the folder `inventory` that contains some of the required input and code to test the performance of 

### Data

The inventory example requires an additional files that contains the mean values for the two performance measures we considered.

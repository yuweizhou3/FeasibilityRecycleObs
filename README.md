## <a name="overview"/> Overview

This repository contains the code for the experiments in the paper "Finding Feasible Systems for Subjective Constraints Using Recycled Observations". We provide the instruction on how to run the codes for the proposed procedures and also include a discussion on how we generate data and perform the testing for the inventory example. 

## <a name="procedure"/> Code for Proposed Procedures

We provide the folder `procedures` that contain the code for Procedure ${\cal RF}$ and the other four alternative procedures ($\text{Recycle}^{\cal B}$, $\text{Restart}^{\rm prob}$, $\text{Restart}^{\rm sum}$, and $\text{Restart}^{\rm max}$). The files are as follows. 
1. `rf.cpp`: this code is used to test the performance of Procedure ${\cal RF}$. 
2. `recycle.cpp`: this code is used to test the performance of Procedure $\text{Recycle}^{\cal B}$. 
3. `restart_prob.cpp`: this code is used to test the performance of Procedure $\text{Restart}^{\rm prob}$.
4. `restart_sum.cpp`: this code is used to test the performance of Procedure $\text{Restart}^{\rm sum}$.
5. `restart_max.cpp`: this code is used to test the performance of Procedure $\text{Restart}^{\rm max}$.
